            <p>Are you ready to talk furniture? Whether yours is beautifully antique, <br>
        handily thrifted, desperately-purchased-when-you-realized-you-had-nothing-to-sit-on, <br>
        or of any other furniture variety, you have it. And if you're a word lover, <br>
        you can class up the joint and maybe even impress a few guests with some detailed knowledge about <br> 
        your stuff! Or the stuff at that fancy hotel you try to stay in once a year.</p>
